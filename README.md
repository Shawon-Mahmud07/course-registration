## Welcome to my project!

## My 3 Project features:

1.Props (short for "properties"): I used Props in my project which is a
cornerstone of React development enabling the efficient transfer of data between
components. props facilitate the flow of data from parent components to child
components. In my project i used it for Customization and Reusability, Dynamic
Rendering and Event Handling.

2.Event Handling: I used handle events in components, such as clicking a button.
Event handlers are functions that i used to be assigned to event listeners in
JSX.

3.Hooks: I also used Hooks which is functions that allow me to "hook into" React
state and lifecycle features from functional components.The most commonly i used
hook is the useState hook for managing state in functional components. Other
hooks i used which is useEffect for fetch data.

## Short summary howI managed state in my assignment project:

At first i Determined,

Defined Data Needs: Identify what data app needs to keep track of.

Used Local State: Started with component-level state (useState) for simple
interactions.

Lift State When Shared: multiple components need the same data, i lifted state
to a common parent component and pass it down as props..

Ensure Data Flow: I managed data flow unidirectional from parent to child
components.

Test and Refactor: Tested my state management and adjust it as my project
evolves.

With these steps, i managed effectively manage state in my React assignments,
keeping my code organized and my UI responsive.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and
some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)
  uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)
  uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

```
